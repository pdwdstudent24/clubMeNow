		<tr><th>Penalty</th><th>How to score and continue play</th></tr>
		
		<tr><td>Lost, or out-of-bounds (white stakes)</td><td>Two-stroke penalty: one stroke for the shot you hit out-of-bounds (OOB), plus another stroke for replacing the ball so you can re-hit. <br><br>Instructions: <ul><li>Drop a ball where you last shot from and continue play. </li><li>If you think you <i>might</i> have lost your ball, or it <i>might</i> have gone OOB you can hit a "provisional" ball, otherwise to keep accurate score you will definitely have to go back to the spot where you hit the ball.</li></ul><i>Example: tee shot OOB. You tee up your ball, sitting 0, hitting 1. You slice your tee shot way right of the white OOB stakes, and it tumbles down a storm drain, so bye-bye the ball is completely lost. That's counts as 1 shot. You tee up again. That's 2. So now you are sitting 2.</i> </td></tr>
		
		<tr><td>Whiff</td><td>Count each time you swing in an effort to hit the ball.</td></tr>
		
		<tr><td>Unplayable lie</td><td>One-stroke penalty: one stroke for moving the ball. Definition: An "unplayable lie" is anything you say it is. If you don't mind taking a one-stroke penalty, you can move your ball any time you want. <br><br>Instructions: <ul><li>Drop the ball (no nearer the hole) within two club lengths of the unplayable lie. </li><li>Or drop the ball as far back as you want, keeping the original spot between you and the hole. </li><li>Or return to the point from which you hit the shot that resulted in the unplayable lie. </li></ul><i>Example: ball plugged in deep grass. You hit a beautiful tee shot into the fairway. Now your ball is on the fairway, sitting 1, hitting 2. You hit again, but your second shot plops into some super-tall grass. Now you're sitting 2, but your ball is un-hittable. You pick up your ball and clean it off (yes, you can clean off your ball, or even replace your ball), and drop the clean ball within 2 club lengths of the spot where it used to be. Now you're sitting 3. <br><br>New in 2019: If your ball is embedded or "plugged" anywhere except in bunker sand, you get "free" relief, yes, even if the ball is in the rough. "Embedded" means the ball's pitch-mark must be below the level of the ground.</i></td></tr>
		
		<tr><td>Water hazard (yellow stakes)</td><td>One-stroke penalty: one stroke for moving the ball. <br><br>Instructions: Play a ball from its original position, as close as possible to the spot from which you played the previous shot. Or drop a ball behind the water hazard, keeping the point at which the original ball last crossed the margin of the hazard between the hole and the spot where you drop the ball, with no limit to how far behind the water hazard you drop it. Or play the ball as it lies without grounding the club for no penalty.</td></tr>
		
		<tr><td>Lateral water hazard (red stakes)</td><td>One-stroke penalty: one stroke for moving the ball. <br><br>Instructions: Play a ball from its original position, as close as possible to the spot from which you played the previous shot.  Or drop a ball outside the hazard <i>within two club lengths</i> of where the ball last crossed the margin of the lateral water hazard (but no nearer the hole), or <i>within two club lengths</i> from a point on the opposite edge of the water hazard equidistant from the hole. Alternately, play the ball as it lies without grounding the club for no penalty.</td></tr>
